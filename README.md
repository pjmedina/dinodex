# dinodex

My nephew loves dinosaurs, so I thought it would be fun to create a "dinodex" for him. The goal of this project is to have an iOS application that uses a Keras model to identify five different types of dinosaurs (my nephew's favourites). This project is inspired by the tutorial: Running Keras models on iOS with CoreML by Adrian Rosebrock.
